cryptography 101

- Hashing: with hashing we process an input of variable length, and use a hashing function to output a fixed-length value. 
  - The same input, will always create the same output. The hashing function needs to be fast, and the result unique.
  - Its hard to reverse engineer the input, hashing is for instance used for creating passwords (we do not want to store the real password!).
